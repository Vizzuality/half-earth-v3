# Half Earth

This project is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool and [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the main library. The map is built using [Arcgis JS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) with the [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) package.

Clone the repo and run `yarn install` to install the needed dependencies.

## Documentation

The documentation is available though this [link](https://vizzuality.github.io/half-earth-v3/).
It uses github pages and the content is generated from the `_docs` folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn docs:serve`

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
