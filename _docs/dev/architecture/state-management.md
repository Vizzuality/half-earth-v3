# State Management

## `reducerRegistry`

For state management we are using `Redux`.
To avoid loading all redux modules on the first load when we initialize the `store` (for detailed implementation check out `store.js` file) we introduced code-splitting as indicated in this [`article`](http://nicolasgallagher.com/redux-modules-and-code-splitting/). There are few files that make it possible:
* `reducerRegistry` - class that enables adding redux reducers to the store's reducer after the store has been already created - loading on-demand. This class has a `register` method that we use for adding reducers to the store on-demand.
* `store`
  * first we register reducers that we need on first load
  ```js
    import reducerRegistry from 'reducerRegistry';
    reducerRegistry.register('location', router.reducer);
  ```
  * we add a listener that listens for new reducers to be registered and replace store's reducer whenever that happens (whenever `register` method from `reducerRegistry` class is called).
* `some-example-redux-module` - we split redux code into self-contained modules that comprise of a reducer, actions and initial state. In their index files that combine all of them together (we give them module's name, i.e. `dataGlobeSpec.js`) we register module into redux's store:
  ```js
  reducerRegistry.registerModule('dataGlobeSpec', {
    actions,
    reducers,
    initialState
  });
  ```

## Redux-modules and `location` state

As described before we create dedicated `store` keys by registering `reducers` through the `reducerRegistry` `class`. We do that to store the data that would back the different components of the app; so content of modals, charts or even the ArcGIS Online portal items specs would be stored that way.
A dedicated folder under `redux-modules` should be created to take care of this flow.
On the other hand, reliyng on [redux-first-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-first-router/v/0.0.9-rudy) `location` key inside `redux` store, we are using a kind of mixed approach to state management. Beyond _bussiness_ data (stored through `redux-modules`) we want to have a shareable _current_ state of the app in every momment; to do that we are updating `location` `query` params each time a change to the app state is triggered. This changes are handled through `selectors` to update components state. More or less this is how it works:

- Have separated keys inside `location` to reference different types of app state. We've created the `globe` key to store app state related to the globe (things like `activeLayers`, `landscapeMode`, `zoom` level, globe `extent`, camera centre `coordinates`... would go inside that key). We've also set a `ui` key to store other states that do not directly reference globe internals but have influence on layout and widgets state.

- We've shamelessly stolen the `utils/stateToUrl` folder from Global Forest Watch. It has some utilities to `parse` and `stringify` query params (doing some `atob` encoding, and also have the `setComponentStateToUrl` function that gets used inside components `actions` to update `location` state).

- So inside the pages `selectors` we merge the `location` state with the `initial state` defined for each page to get the _actual_ state of the app and pass it to page components to define the way they should be displayed (both `globe` and `ui` state).
