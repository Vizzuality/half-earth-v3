## Intro  
{: .no_toc }

This documentation is mainly an onboarding document to the Half Earth project for Vizzuality members.  
It is fundamentally focused on developers, although there are general subjects that could benefit any stakeholder on providing them with some useful context on project's jargon and current state.

You will find emojis here and there on the buttons/links of this documentation. The intention is to clarify target reader of the documentation piece those links redirect to. General useful content pieces would be tagged as Stakeholder focused, that is, any functional area or individual could benefit somehow of reading those pieces.
Target readers:  
- Stakeholders 🌍
- Developers 👩🏽‍💻
- Scientists 🧑‍🔬
- Resigners 🧑‍🎨

## About the Half-Earth project   

🐡 🦎 🦉 🐍 🐋 🌲 🦧 🌵  

We are living in the sixth mass extinction. __Half-Earth is a call to protect half the land and sea in order to manage sufficient habitat to slow down the species extinction crisis and ensure the long-term health of our planet__. The Half-Earth Project is working to safeguard global biodiversity through detailed mapping of biodiversity, protected areas, and human activities. This information is then used to identify the places and species most in need of conservation action.
