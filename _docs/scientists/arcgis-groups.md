# ArcGIS groups
## Difference between groups and folders
Only you can see your folders and from these folders the items can be shared with several groups. Groups are made out of users from the organisation. Groups can be used to determine different terms of use of the items shared within: only for internal use, for publication. 

## Groups for sharing services across the organisation
[*original basecamp conversation*](https://basecamp.com/1756858/projects/13899003/messages/89528752)
- Items are shared during data processing and development between different team members of Map Of Life and Vizzuality.  Within Vizzuality we use [`Vizzuality Development Group`](https://eowilson.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=46783c33c294485abe83f5e899c2f21f). Biodiversity services shared within this group are for design and prototyping purposes only. It is possible that the layers are shared with `Everyone`, but their usage is limited (see [Services Whitelisting](/_docs/science/whitelisting) for further details).
- The biodiversity layers shared by Map Of Life for design and development purposes **ONLY** are shared by MOL members through the [`MOL-Vizzuality group`](https://eowilson.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=3effcb0b695b4c22a8022b6715c01ff0).
- The biodiverstiy layers that are available to use publicly in the web app are found in the [`Half-Earth App Layers Group`](https://eowilson.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=9435b010c9c7488b9a7d4482022117dd)
