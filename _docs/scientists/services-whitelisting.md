# Services whitelisting  

Map of Life is the data provider of the biodiversity data. Some layers are hosted in the Living Atlas, but those that are not yet published are either provided by the MOL API or as transition into any of those two hosting services they are in the arcgis online organisation page. When the data is served from arcgis online a set of links have to be whitelisted. Reach to the dev team to get the list. To whitelist follow the instructions in the [science wiki](https://github.com/Vizzuality/sci-team-wiki/wiki/ESRI---ArcGIS-Online#whitelisting-services-see-here-for-the-step-by-step-esri-help){:target="_blank"}.
