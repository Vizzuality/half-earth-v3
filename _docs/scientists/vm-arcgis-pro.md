# Using the Virtual Machine and ArcGIS Pro
ArcGIS Pro only runs on windows machines. Check lastpass to obtain the information to access the Virtual Machine. Only one person can be using the Virtual Machine at a time. 

## ArcGIS Pro projects
In the My Documents folder the Arcgis folder contains a Project folder. Each project folder has a project file with its own geodatabase. All the current data in the web app is stored in the ArcGIS online organisation or in the Azure bucket. Old ArcGIS projects are backed up in the arcgis online organisation.
