## The Half-Earth project map.
We are living in the sixth mass extinction. Half-Earth is a call to protect half the land and sea in order to manage sufficient habitat to slow down the species extinction crisis and ensure the long-term health of our planet. The Half-Earth Project is working to safeguard global biodiversity through detailed mapping of biodiversity, protected areas, and human activities. This information is then used to identify the places and species most in need of conservation action. GIS is at the core of determining which places to protect.

The Half-Earth Project Map provides an interactive summary of progress toward this goal, offered as a tool to help contextualize global datasets of biodiversity, human encroachment, and protection.
