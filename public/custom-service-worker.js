/**
 * Kill-switch Service Worker (custom-service-worker.js)
 *
 * Purpose
 * - This SW exists only to help clients that previously installed our Workbox service worker
 *   to automatically unregister and clear caches after we removed PWA caching from the app.
 * - It performs no caching and lets the network handle all requests.
 *
 * Scope
 * - Served at: /custom-service-worker.js
 * - Complements a legacy kill-switch at /service-worker.js for CRA-era registrations.
 * - Safe to deploy alongside the app; does nothing beyond unregister + cache cleanup.
 *
 * Removal policy
 * - Keep for a limited window to catch long-tail users (recommended 6â€“12 weeks).
 * - Target removal date: UPDATE_BEFORE_MERGE (2025-11-01).
 * - After removal, ensure normal HTTP cache headers are set (e.g., no-store for index.html).
 *
 * Notes for contributors
 * - Do NOT add caching strategies here. This file is intentionally minimal.
 * - If you reintroduce a real SW in the future, remove this file and replace with a proper
 *   update-notification flow to avoid stale clients.
