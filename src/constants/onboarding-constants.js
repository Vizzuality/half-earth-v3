In this ranking of priority places, yellow areas correspond to those with higher priority for conservation, as they contribute to safeguarding habitats protecting the most species. Blue tones refer to areas of lower priority values. Areas with no color have not been identified as a part of the global network needed for comprehensive biodiversity protection, but may still contain places of unique and irreplaceable value to biodiversity. In the Amazon, priority areas, like these in the Andes, correspond to the thick yellow stripe on the Western part of the continent, as well as a significant area throughout the Amazon River Basin. Note that our priority models are a starting point of identifying high-impact conservation protection. By changing parameters on the map, different conservation factors shift outcomes. In addition, other parameters involving various socio-economic factors must play a role in specific conservation efforts ultimately undertaken.' },

The SPI provides an estimation of how well each country is meeting conservation targets by considering the amount of land or sea currently protected, the number of rare species, as well as the total number of species found both inside and outside protected areas. Using the accumulation of this data, the National Report Cards provide an answer to the question of how well each country is doing to protect the biodiversity it has stewardship over. On the Half-Earth Project Map, each country in the world is colored by their SPI value. From no color at 100, through progressively lighter shades of purple and red to bright orange at 0. Generally, the SPI is higher in countries effectively managing species diversity and promoting conservation within its borders. A lower SPI score demonstrates a need for more conservation efforts.`},

For this reason, most biodiversity hotspots have relatively lower SPI scores when compared to countries with less biodiversity richness and rarity. In light of this, it’s important to also consider approaches for sharing the costs of saving biodiversity within nations that benefit the entire world. In the long run, conserving biodiversity pays a net economic benefit. `},
