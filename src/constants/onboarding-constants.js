Using the accumulation of this data, the National Report Cards provide an answer to the question of how well each country is doing to protect the biodiversity it has stewardship over. On the Half-Earth Project Map, each country in the world is colored by their SPI value. From no color at 100, through progressively lighter shades of purple and red to bright orange at 0. Generally, the SPI is higher in countries effectively managing species diversity and promoting conservation within its borders.
