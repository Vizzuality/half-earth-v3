    "Here, all the available spatial datasets are listed for the selected species. They are divided between publicly available data sourced from Map of Life and private data sourced from your organization's ArcGIS online database. Additionally, there are a set of regional layers, including administrative boundaries and protected areas. These layers can be enabled to display on the map and further explored.",
  INDICATORS:
    'Here, you can view and explore the selected species Protection and Habitat Scores. A graph of change over time in the score value is displayed along the table. The table displays information about the species protection or habitat scores in all countries that species live in. In the drop down menu, you can select which country you want to compare the conservation status of the species with the RDC. In the screenshot below, we see that the species has a protection score of 95 in the RDC, whereas in Guinea it has a score of 75, and globally, the species has a score of 100. Changing the comparison country will also update the graph, so you can view how the protection score of the species has changed over time in a different country compared to the RDC.',
